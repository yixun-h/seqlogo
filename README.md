# seqlogo
#this file is a r file to plot sequence logos (in bits and probabilities)  based on a frequency matrix of nucleotide in a multiply alignment of sequences
#before running the .r file, 
#use 'tail -n +2 file >> file' to remove the first line (idline) of the input file.
#in this case, MA0007.1.pfm is the raw file and MA0007.pfm is the input file with id line removed.
#open this r file in R or Rstudio, and run it.
